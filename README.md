# colorfilter
A gnome extension to desaturate and filter colors.

The code originates from https://github.com/amarovita/tint-all, with custom changes, bug fixes and port to new versions of Gnome.

# Installing

To install the extension:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/let-def/colorfilter.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/colorfilter@def.lakaban.net
```

# Configuring

The extension adds a new palette-shaped icon ðŸŽ¨ in the tray (upper-right corner of the screen).
By default no effect is applied.

Click on the icon to cycle between different filters: red, green, blue, gray and sepia.

Use the mouse wheel on the icon to adjust the intensity.
